# credit-card-fraud-detection<br>
**Credit card fraud refers to a term where a fraud is
committed by either using a credit or debit card. The purpose
behind this type of fraud is to obtain either goods or services that
benefit the person committing the fraud. Many machine learning
and deep learning algorithms can be used to detect these frauds.
This research works shows various algorithms that can be used to
identify these fraudulent activities. During pre-processing it was
observed that the data-set was highly imbalanced for which
SMOTE technique was applied. Moreover, PCA was applied to
find meaningful basis or coordinates to achieve optimal results.
The data-set was split into train and test sets on which experiments
were performed. The algorithms used in this experiment were
Logistic regression, SVM, K-means, Decision tree, Random
Forest, Auto-encoder and Neural Network. Results conclude that
each algorithm can be used for credit card fraud detection.
However, to achieve optimal results, random forest and neural
networks should be applied. Moreover, these algorithms can be
applied on real time data.**
